/*
Given two positive integers num1 and num2, find the positive integer x such that:

    x has the same number of set bits as num2, and
    The value x XOR num1 is minimal.

Note that XOR is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return the integer x. The test cases are generated such that x is uniquely determined.

The number of set bits of an integer is the number of 1's in its binary representation.

 

Example 1:

Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0011 and 0101, respectively.
The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 3 = 0 is minimal.

Example 2:

Input: num1 = 1, num2 = 12
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0001 and 1100, respectively.
The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 1 = 2 is minimal.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= num1, num2 <= 10^9
